Step to solve of Bubble Sort Technique in Java : 

1. Start at the beginning of the list.
2. Compare the first two elements. If the first is greater than the second, swap them.
3. Move to the next pair of elements (second and third) and repeat the comparison and swap if necessary.
4. Continue this process until the end of the list is reached. Now, the largest element is at the end.
5. Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted elements (excluding the last one, as it is already in its correct position).
6. Continue these passes until the entire list is sorted.


CODE : 

public class Bubble {

	public static int bubble(int arr[]) {
		int n = arr.length;
		for(int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
			boolean flag = false;
			for(int j = 0;j < n-i-1; j++){
				if(arr[i] > arr[j]) {
					int temp = arr[i];
					arr[i] = arr[j];
					arr[j] = temp;
					flag = true;
				}
			}
			if(flag == false) 
				break;
		}
		return n;
		
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int arr[] = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
		System.out.print(bubble(arr));
	}

}

Time Complexity : O(N^2)
Space Complexity : O(1)
